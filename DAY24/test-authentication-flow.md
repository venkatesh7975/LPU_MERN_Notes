# Authentication Flow Test Guide

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

1. **Navigation Issue**: Changed `window.location.href = '/group-chat'` to `navigate('/group-chat')` in Dashboard component
2. **User State Monitoring**: Added debug logging to track user state changes
3. **Route Protection**: Enhanced route protection for group chat access
4. **Debug Component**: Added AuthDebug component to monitor authentication state

## 🧪 Testing Steps

### Step 1: Check Backend Health
```bash
# Test if backend is running
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://groupchat-with-payment.onrender.com/api/health" -Method GET
```

### Step 2: Test Authentication Flow

1. **Open the app**: Go to `http://localhost:5173`
2. **Check console logs**: Look for the debug information
3. **Create account**: Click "Sign up" and fill in details
4. **Check email**: Look for OTP in your email
5. **Enter OTP**: Complete the verification
6. **Check dashboard**: Verify you're logged in
7. **Test group chat**: Click "Open Group Chat"

### Step 3: Debug Information

The app now shows a debug panel (top-right corner) with:
- Loading status
- User information
- Group member status
- Token presence
- Current path

### Step 4: Console Logs to Watch

Look for these console messages:
- `🚀 App mounted, checking auth status...`
- `🔐 Is authenticated: true/false`
- `✅ Authentication successful, user: {...}`
- `🔍 Group chat route - user: {...}`
- `✅ User authenticated and is group member - rendering GroupChat`

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Redirected to login after clicking "Open Chat"
**Cause**: User state was lost due to page reload
**Solution**: Fixed by using React Router navigation instead of `window.location.href`

### Issue 2: "User not a group member" error
**Cause**: User hasn't paid for group chat access
**Solution**: Complete the payment process in dashboard

### Issue 3: Token not found
**Cause**: Authentication token expired or invalid
**Solution**: Log out and log in again

## 🔍 Debug Commands

Add these to browser console for debugging:

```javascript
// Check current user state
console.log('User:', window.user);

// Check token
console.log('Token:', localStorage.getItem('token'));

// Clear everything and reload
localStorage.clear();
window.location.reload();

// Force logout
window.logout();
```

## 📱 Expected Behavior

1. **Login Page**: Shows when no user is authenticated
2. **Dashboard**: Shows after successful login
3. **Group Chat**: Only accessible to paid members
4. **Debug Panel**: Shows authentication state (development only)

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Test the complete authentication flow
2. Check if group chat opens properly
3. Verify user state persists across navigation
4. Test payment flow if needed
