# 🎒 Chapter 5: **“Anvi Learns to Operate”**

**(JavaScript Operators in Real Life)**

---

### 🧍 Characters Recap:

* **Anvi** – Smart, learning JS with bags (variables).
* **Letti** – Organized, modern coder (`let`)
* **Consti** – Disciplined (`const`)
* **Teacher** – Explains rules like JavaScript

## 🏫 Scene: "Maths & Logic Day at School"

Anvi walks into class. Today, the teacher says:

> “Class! Today we’ll learn how to **use the items in your bags to do operations** — like adding, comparing, and deciding things!”

---

## ✍️ What are Operators?

> Operators are like **tools or symbols** that let you **do actions** with values inside variables.

Let’s break them down with **Anvi's real school examples**.

---

## 🧮 1. **Arithmetic Operators** (For Math)

Anvi gets some snacks from home:

```js
let apple = 2;
let banana = 3;
```

She counts them:

```js
let total = apple + banana; // 5
```

| Operator | Meaning          | Example  | Result |
| -------- | ---------------- | -------- | ------ |
| `+`      | Add              | `2 + 3`  | 5      |
| `-`      | Subtract         | `5 - 2`  | 3      |
| `*`      | Multiply         | `2 * 3`  | 6      |
| `/`      | Divide           | `6 / 2`  | 3      |
| `%`      | Remainder        | `5 % 2`  | 1      |
| `**`     | Exponent (power) | `2 ** 3` | 8      |

🧃 **Anvi's Use Case**: She splits 5 chocolates among 2 friends. `5 % 2` tells her 1 is left.

---

## 👯‍♀️ 2. **Assignment Operators** (Putting things in bags)

Anvi receives 5 pencils.

```js
let pencils = 5;
```

Later she gives away 2.

```js
pencils -= 2; // pencils = pencils - 2 => 3
```

| Operator | Meaning           | Example  | Same As     |
| -------- | ----------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| `=`      | Assign            | `x = 5`  | —           |
| `+=`     | Add & Assign      | `x += 2` | `x = x + 2` |
| `-=`     | Subtract & Assign | `x -= 1` | `x = x - 1` |
| `*=`     | Multiply & Assign | `x *= 3` | `x = x * 3` |
| `/=`     | Divide & Assign   | `x /= 2` | `x = x / 2` |

🧠 Anvi’s note: *"These help me update my bag contents easily!"*

---

## 👀 3. **Comparison Operators** (Ask Yes/No Questions)

Anvi compares her snacks with Letti’s.

```js
let mySnacks = 3;
let lettiSnacks = 5;
```

```js
mySnacks < lettiSnacks // true
mySnacks == lettiSnacks // false
```

| Operator | Meaning                         | Example     | Result |
| -------- | ------------------------------- | ----------- | ------ |
| `==`     | Equal (loose)                   | `"5" == 5`  | true   |
| `===`    | Equal (strict, checks type too) | `"5" === 5` | false  |
| `!=`     | Not equal                       | `3 != 4`    | true   |
| `!==`    | Not equal (strict)              | `"3" !== 3` | true   |
| `>`      | Greater than                    | `5 > 2`     | true   |
| `<`      | Less than                       | `2 < 5`     | true   |
| `>=`     | Greater or Equal                | `5 >= 5`    | true   |
| `<=`     | Less or Equal                   | `3 <= 2`    | false  |

👩‍🏫 Teacher says:

> Use `===` if you want to be **strict** — like checking if the snack type and quantity are **exactly** the same.

---

## 🔀 4. **Logical Operators** (For Decisions)

Anvi wants to play **only if**:

* It’s not raining
* She finished homework

```js
let notRaining = true;
let homeworkDone = true;

if (notRaining && homeworkDone) {
  console.log("Go out and play!");
}
```

| Operator | Meaning          | Example        | Result            |        |   |         |      |
| -------- | ---------------- | -------------- | ----------------- | ------ | - | ------- | ---- |
| `&&`     | AND – both true  | `true && true` | true              |        |   |         |      |
| \`       |                  | \`             | OR – at least one | \`true |   | false\` | true |
| `!`      | NOT – reverse it | `!true`        | false             |        |   |         |      |

🧠 Anvi’s Use Case:

```js
if (isHoliday || isSunday) {
  console.log("No school!");
}
```

---

## 🔢 5. **Increment & Decrement**

Anvi gets stars for doing chores.

```js
let stars = 0;
stars++; // stars = stars + 1
stars--; // stars = stars - 1
```

| Operator | Meaning    | Example | Result          |
| -------- | ---------- | ------- | --------------- |
| `++`     | Add 1      | `x++`   | x becomes x + 1 |
| `--`     | Subtract 1 | `x--`   | x becomes x - 1 |

---

## 🧩 6. **Ternary Operator** – Shortcut Decision Tool

Anvi wants to know if she passed:

```js
let marks = 80;
let result = marks >= 35 ? "Pass" : "Fail";
console.log(result); // Pass
```

> ✅ If `condition` is true, return first value. If false, return second.

```js
condition ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse
```

### 🏁 Final Scene:

At the end of the day, Anvi tells Letti:

> “Just like in school, in JavaScript we do math, check rules, and make decisions — all using **operators**!”
