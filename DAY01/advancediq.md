## 1. Internet

### Basic

**Q1: What is the Internet, and how does it function at a high level?**  
**Answer**:  
The Internet is a global network of interconnected computers and devices communicating via standardized protocols like TCP/IP. It functions by:

- **Devices** connecting through networks (LAN, WAN) via ISPs.
- **Data** transmitted as packets routed using IP addresses.
- **Protocols** (e.g., HTTP, DNS) ensuring reliable communication.  
  For example, when a user visits a website, their browser sends an HTTP request to a server, which responds with data (HTML, JSON) routed through multiple networks.

**Q2: What is the role of TCP/IP in the Internet?**  
**Answer**:  
TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is the foundation of Internet communication:

- **IP**: Assigns unique addresses (e.g., 192.168.1.1) to devices and routes data packets.
- **TCP**: Ensures reliable data delivery by managing packet order, error checking, and retransmission.  
  Together, they enable devices to locate each other and exchange data accurately, e.g., loading a webpage or streaming video.

### Intermediate

**Q3: How does the Internet handle packet loss, and why is it important in real-time applications?**  
**Answer**:  
Packet loss occurs when data packets fail to reach their destination due to network congestion or errors. TCP handles this by:

- Detecting missing packets via sequence numbers.
- Requesting retransmission of lost packets.  
  For real-time applications (e.g., video calls), UDP is often used instead of TCP because it prioritizes speed over reliability, avoiding retransmission delays. However, applications like Zoom implement custom error correction (e.g., Forward Error Correction) to mitigate packet loss without compromising performance.

**Q4: Explain how Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) improve Internet performance.**  
**Answer**:  
CDNs are distributed networks of servers that cache website content (e.g., images, scripts) closer to users. They improve performance by:

- **Reducing Latency**: Serving content from edge servers near the user.
- **Load Balancing**: Distributing traffic across servers to prevent overload.
- **Caching**: Storing static assets to reduce server requests.  
  For example, Cloudflare caches a website’s static files globally, speeding up load times for users in different regions.

### Advanced

**Q5: How would you design a system to handle Internet-scale traffic for a global e-commerce platform?**  
**Answer**:  
To handle Internet-scale traffic (e.g., millions of users):

1. **Architecture**: Use a microservices-based architecture for scalability, with services for user authentication, product catalog, payments, etc.
2. **Load Balancing**: Deploy load balancers (e.g., AWS ELB, Nginx) to distribute traffic across multiple servers.
3. **CDN**: Use a CDN like Akamai to cache static content (images, CSS) and reduce server load.
4. **Database**: Use a combination of SQL (e.g., PostgreSQL for transactions) and NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB for product data) for scalability.
5. **Caching**: Implement Redis or Memcached for frequently accessed data (e.g., user sessions).
6. **Scalability**: Use containerization (Docker) and orchestration (Kubernetes) to auto-scale servers based on demand.
7. **Monitoring**: Use tools like Prometheus and Grafana to monitor traffic and performance.  
   For example, Amazon uses AWS services like Route 53 (DNS), S3 (storage), and Lambda (serverless) to handle Black Friday traffic spikes.

**Q6: How do protocols like QUIC improve Internet performance over traditional HTTP?**  
**Answer**:  
QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections), used in HTTP/3, improves performance by:

- **UDP-Based**: Reduces latency by avoiding TCP’s handshake and retransmission overhead.
- **Multiplexing**: Allows multiple streams in a single connection without head-of-line blocking, unlike TCP.
- **Built-in Encryption**: Integrates TLS 1.3, reducing handshake time.
- **Connection Migration**: Maintains connections during network changes (e.g., Wi-Fi to mobile data).  
  For example, Google uses QUIC for YouTube, reducing video buffering by up to 30% compared to HTTP/2.

**Answer**:  
To secure a private network for remote employees:

1. **VPN**: Use a Virtual Private Network (e.g., OpenVPN) to encrypt connections.
2. **Authentication**: Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for access.
3. **Firewalls**: Deploy firewalls to filter traffic and prevent unauthorized access.
4. **Private IPs**: Use private IP ranges (e.g., 192.168.x.x) to isolate internal traffic.
5. **Endpoint Security**: Ensure employee devices have updated antivirus and secure configurations.
6. **Monitoring**: Use tools like Splunk to detect suspicious activity.  
   For example, a tech company might use AWS VPN and Okta for secure remote access to its private network.

**Q4: What are the challenges of using public networks for sensitive operations?**  
**Answer**:  
Challenges include:

- **Security Risks**: Public networks are prone to man-in-the-middle attacks, packet sniffing, and malware.
- **Unreliable Performance**: Shared bandwidth can cause slowdowns.
- **Lack of Control**: No control over network infrastructure or policies.  
  Mitigation: Use HTTPS, VPNs, and encrypted protocols (e.g., SSH) to secure communication. For example, a developer accessing a public Wi-Fi should use a VPN to safely push code to GitHub.

### Advanced

**Q5: How would you design a hybrid network combining public and private networks for a global organization?**  
**Answer**:  

A hybrid network integrates public and private networks for flexibility and security:

1. **Private Network**: Host sensitive services (e.g., databases, internal APIs) on a private network using AWS VPC or on-premises servers.
2. **Public Network**: Use public cloud services (e.g., AWS S3 for static assets) for scalability.
3. **VPN/Direct Connect**: Securely connect private and public networks using AWS Direct Connect or a VPN.
4. **Zero Trust**: Implement Zero Trust security (e.g., BeyondCorp) to verify all access, regardless of network.
5. **Load Balancing**: Use public CDNs (e.g., Cloudflare) for external traffic and private load balancers for internal services.
6. **Monitoring**: Deploy SIEM tools (e.g., Splunk) to monitor threats across both networks.  
   Example: A global retailer uses a private network for inventory management and a public CDN for customer-facing websites.

**Q6: How do you mitigate DDoS attacks on a public network hosting a critical application?**  
**Answer**:  
To mitigate Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks:

1. **CDN**: Use a CDN like Cloudflare to absorb and distribute attack traffic.
2. **Rate Limiting**: Limit requests per IP to prevent overload (e.g., using Nginx).
3. **WAF**: Deploy a Web Application Firewall to filter malicious traffic.
4. **Auto-Scaling**: Configure cloud services (e.g., AWS Auto Scaling) to handle traffic spikes.
5. **Geo-Blocking**: Restrict traffic from suspicious regions.

## 4. DNS

### Basic

**Q1: What is DNS, and why is it important?**  
**Answer**:  
DNS (Domain Name System) translates domain names (e.g., google.com) into IP addresses (e.g., 142.250.190.78) that computers use to locate servers. It’s important because:

- Simplifies access with human-readable names.
- Enables load balancing by mapping domains to multiple IPs.
- Critical for website, email, and service connectivity.

**Q2: What is an A record in DNS?**  
**Answer**:  
An A (Address) record maps a domain name to an IPv4 address. For example:

```
example.com. 3600 IN A 192.0.2.1
```

When a browser queries `example.com`, DNS returns `192.0.2.1`, allowing connection to the server.

### Intermediate

**Q3: How does DNS caching impact website performance?**  
**Answer**:  
DNS caching stores resolved IP addresses locally (e.g., in browsers, OS, or ISPs) to reduce lookup time:

- **Pros**: Faster subsequent requests, reduced DNS server load.
- **Cons**: Can cause delays in reflecting DNS changes (e.g., after server migration).
- **TTL (Time to Live)**: Controls cache duration (e.g., 3600 seconds).  
  Example: Google’s 8.8.8.8 resolver caches DNS records to speed up queries but may delay updates if TTL is high.

**Q4: What happens if a DNS server fails to resolve a domain?**  
**Answer**:  
If a DNS server fails:

- The client retries with a secondary DNS server (e.g., 8.8.4.4 if 8.8.8.8 fails).
- If all resolvers fail, the user sees an error (e.g., “Site can’t be reached”).
- **Mitigation**: Use multiple DNS providers (e.g., Route 53, Cloudflare) and configure failover.  
  Example: A retail website uses Route 53 with health checks to switch to a backup DNS server during outages.

### Advanced

**Q5: How would you secure a DNS infrastructure for a large-scale application?**  
**Answer**:  
To secure DNS:

1. **DNSSEC**: Enable DNS Security Extensions to validate responses and prevent DNS spoofing.
2. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent DDoS attacks by limiting query rates.
3. **Anycast**: Distribute DNS servers globally for redundancy and low latency.
4. **Monitoring**: Use tools like Zabbix to detect anomalies (e.g., query spikes).
5. **Access Control**: Restrict DNS zone transfers to authorized servers.  
   Example: A financial platform uses Cloudflare’s DNSSEC and Anycast DNS to ensure secure and reliable resolution.

**Q6: How do you handle DNS propagation delays when migrating a website to a new server?**  
**Answer**:  
DNS propagation delays occur due to caching and TTL settings. To minimize impact:

1. **Reduce TTL**: Lower TTL (e.g., to 300 seconds) days before migration to speed up cache refresh.
2. **Pre-Test**: Verify new server setup using direct IP access or `hosts` file edits.
3. **Monitor**: Use tools like `dig` or `nslookup` to track propagation.
4. **Fallback**: Keep the old server running until propagation completes.
5. **CDN**: Use a CDN to redirect traffic to the new server post-migration.  
   Example: An e-commerce site migrating to AWS reduces TTL to 300 seconds a week before switching IPs to minimize downtime.

  Example: An e-commerce site uses HTTPS to secure user payment data.

### Intermediate

**Q3: How do query parameters in a URL impact application design?**  
**Answer**:  
Query parameters (`?key=value`) pass data to the server or client:

- **Use Cases**: Filtering (e.g., `?category=books`), pagination (e.g., `?page=2`).
- **Design Impact**:
  - Backend must parse and validate parameters to prevent injection attacks.
  - Frontend may use parameters for state (e.g., React Router).
  - Requires URL encoding to handle special characters.  
    Example: A search page (`/search?q=phone`) uses query parameters to filter results securely.

**Q4: How would you handle URL redirects in a web application?**  
**Answer**:  
To handle redirects:

1. **Server-Side**: Use HTTP status codes (301 for permanent, 302 for temporary) in frameworks like Express:
   ```javascript
   app.get("/old-url", (req, res) => res.redirect(301, "/new-url"));
   ```
2. **Client-Side**: Use JavaScript (e.g., `window.location.href = '/new-url'`) or React Router.
3. **SEO**: Ensure 301 redirects for SEO to transfer page authority.
4. **Monitoring**: Track redirect performance with Google Analytics.  
   Example: A legacy product page redirects to a new URL with a 301 to preserve SEO ranking.

   ```javascript
   const jwt = require("jsonwebtoken");
   const auth = (req, res, next) => {
     const token = req.header("Authorization");
     if (!token) return res.status(401).send("Access denied");
     try {
       req.user = jwt.verify(token, "secret");
       next();
     } catch (error) {
       res.status(400).send("Invalid token");
     }
   };
   app.get("/protected", auth, (req, res) => res.send("Protected data"));
   ```
3. **Secure Storage**: Store tokens securely (e.g., HttpOnly cookies).  
   Example: A user login API issues a JWT, verified by middleware for protected routes.

  const db = client.db("mydb");
  const collection = db.collection("users");

  // Create
  await collection.insertOne({ name: "John", age: 30 });
  // Read
  const user = await collection.findOne({ name: "John" });
  // Update
  await collection.updateOne({ name: "John" }, { $set: { age: 31 } });
  // Delete
  await collection.deleteOne({ name: "John" });
}
run();
```

This performs Create, Read, Update, Delete operations.

### Intermediate

**Q3: How do you index a MongoDB collection for performance?**  
**Answer**:  
Indexes improve query performance:

- **Create Index**: `db.users.createIndex({ email: 1 })` for ascending index on `email`.
- **Compound Index**: `db.users.createIndex({ name: 1, age: -1 })` for multi-field queries.
- **Analyze**: Use `explain()` to check index usage.  
  Example: Indexing `email` speeds up user login queries.

**Q4: How do you handle transactions in MongoDB?**  
**Answer**:  
MongoDB supports transactions since version 4.0:

```javascript
const session = client.startSession();
session.withTransaction(async () => {
  const users = db.collection("users");
  await users.updateOne(
    { name: "John" },
    { $set: { balance: 100 } },
    { session }
  );
  await users.updateOne(
    { name: "Jane" },
    { $set: { balance: 200 } },
    { session }
  );
});
```

This ensures atomic updates across multiple documents.
