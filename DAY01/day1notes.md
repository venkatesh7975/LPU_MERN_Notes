## 1. Internet
The Internet is a global network of interconnected computers and devices that communicate using standardized protocols, primarily TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol). It enables the exchange of data, resources, and services across the world.

- **Key Components**:
  - **Hardware**: Routers, switches, servers, and client devices (computers, smartphones).
  - **Protocols**: HTTP/HTTPS (web), FTP (file transfer), SMTP (email), DNS (domain name resolution).
  - **Infrastructure**: Internet Service Providers (ISPs), data centers, and undersea cables.
- **How It Works**:
  - Devices connect to networks (LAN, WAN) that are linked via ISPs.
  - Data is transmitted in packets, routed through networks using IP addresses.
  - Protocols ensure reliable communication and data integrity.

---

## 2. Network: Public Network vs. Private Network
A network is a collection of devices connected to share resources and communicate. Networks can be classified as public or private based on access and ownership.

### Public Network
- **Definition**: A network accessible to anyone, typically the Internet or networks provided by ISPs.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Open to the public; no restricted access.
  - Often less secure due to widespread accessibility.
  - Examples: Wi-Fi hotspots in cafes, public Internet.
- **Use Cases**: General browsing, accessing public services, social media.
- **Security**: Requires firewalls, VPNs, or encryption to protect data.
- **Advantages**: Wide accessibility, cost-effective for users.
- **Disadvantages**: Vulnerable to cyberattacks, limited control over infrastructure.

### Private Network
- **Definition**: A restricted network accessible only to authorized users, often within an organization.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Controlled access via authentication (e.g., passwords, VPNs).
  - Higher security with firewalls, encryption, and private IP addressing.
  - Examples: Corporate intranets, home Wi-Fi networks.
- **Use Cases**: Business operations, secure data sharing, internal communications.
- **Security**: Enhanced with private IP ranges (e.g., 192.168.x.x), VPNs, and access controls.
- **Advantages**: Secure, customizable, reliable for internal use.
- **Disadvantages**: Higher setup and maintenance costs, limited accessibility.

## 3. Websites
A website is a collection of web pages accessible via the Internet, hosted on a server, and identified by a domain name or IP address.

### Components of a Website
- **Frontend**: The user interface (UI) displayed in browsers (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
- **Backend**: Server-side logic, databases, and APIs handling data and functionality.
- **Hosting**: Servers that store and serve website files.
- **Domain Name**: A human-readable address (e.g., example.com) mapped to an IP address via DNS.

### Types of Websites
1. **Static Websites**:
   - Fixed content, no dynamic updates.
   - Built with HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript.
   - Examples: Portfolios, informational pages.
   - Pros: Fast, cheap, secure.
   - Cons: Limited interactivity, manual updates.
2. **Dynamic Websites**:
   - Content changes based on user input or data (e.g., e-commerce, social media).
   - Uses server-side scripting (PHP, Python) and databases.
   - Pros: Interactive, scalable.
   - Cons: Complex, resource-intensive.
3. **E-commerce Websites**:
   - Online stores for selling products/services (e.g., Amazon).
   - Features: Shopping carts, payment gateways, product catalogs.
4. **Blogs**:
   - Content-focused sites for articles or posts (e.g., WordPress blogs).
   - Often use Content Management Systems (CMS).
5. **Portals**:
   - Centralized platforms for specific audiences (e.g., employee portals, government sites).
   - Features: User authentication, personalized content.
6. **Social Media Websites**:
   - Platforms for user interaction and content sharing (e.g., X, Facebook).
   - Highly dynamic, with real-time updates and APIs.
7. **Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)**:

   - Examples: Twitter Lite, Starbucks PWA.
8. **Single-Page Applications (SPAs)**:
   - Load a single HTML page, dynamically updating content (see SPA vs. MPA below).
   - Examples: Gmail, Google Maps.

---

## 4. DNS (Domain Name System)
DNS is the Internet’s phonebook, translating human-readable domain names (e.g., google.com) into IP addresses (e.g., 142.250.190.78) that computers use to locate servers.

### How DNS Works
1. **User Request**: A user enters a URL in a browser.
2. **DNS Resolver**: The browser queries a DNS resolver (often provided by an ISP).
3. **Root Servers**: The resolver contacts root servers to find the top-level domain (TLD, e.g., .com).
4. **TLD Servers**: Directs the query to authoritative name servers for the domain.
5. **Authoritative Server**: Returns the IP address for the requested domain.
6. **Response**: The browser uses the IP address to fetch the website.

### Key Components
- **Domain Name**: Hierarchical structure (e.g., subdomain.example.com).
  - Subdomain: www, blog.
  - Domain: example.
  - TLD: .com, .org.
- **DNS Records**:
  - **A Record**: Maps domain to IPv4 address.
  - **AAAA Record**: Maps domain to IPv6 address.
  - **CNAME**: Alias for another domain.
  - **MX**: Mail server for the domain.
  - **TXT**: Text-based records for verification or metadata.
- **DNS Resolver**: A server that handles DNS queries (e.g., Google’s 8.8.8.8).

### Importance
- Simplifies access to websites using memorable names.
- Enables load balancing and redundancy (multiple IP addresses for one domain).
- Critical for email, services, and Internet connectivity.

## 5. SPA vs. MPA (Single-Page Application vs. Multi-Page Application)
Websites and web applications can be built as SPAs or MPAs, differing in structure and user experience.

### Single-Page Application (SPA)
- **Definition**: A web app that loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates content using JavaScript.
- **How It Works**:
  - Initial HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are loaded.
  - Client-side JavaScript (e.g., React, Vue.js) fetches data via APIs and updates the UI without full page reloads.
- **Examples**: Gmail, Google Maps, Trello.
- **Pros**:
  - Fast user experience (no page reloads).
  - Smooth, app-like interactions.
  - Reduced server load for rendering.
- **Cons**:
  - Slower initial load (large JavaScript bundles).
  - SEO challenges (requires server-side rendering or pre-rendering).
  - Higher client-side complexity.
- **Technologies**: React, Angular, Vue.js, AJAX, REST APIs.

### Multi-Page Application (MPA)
- **Definition**: A traditional web app with multiple HTML pages, each loaded separately from the server.
- **How It Works**:
  - Each user action (e.g., clicking a link) triggers a new page request.
  - Server renders and sends a new HTML page.
- **Examples**: Traditional e-commerce sites, news websites.
- **Pros**:
  - SEO-friendly (search engines can easily crawl multiple pages).
  - Simpler to build for static content.
  - Better for large, content-heavy sites.
- **Cons**:
  - Slower navigation (full page reloads).
  - Less interactive compared to SPAs.
  - Higher server load for rendering.
- **Technologies**: HTML, CSS, server-side frameworks (Django, Laravel).

### SPA vs. MPA: Key Differences

## 6. URL (Uniform Resource Locator)
A URL is the address used to locate resources on the Internet, such as web pages, images, or files.

### Structure of a URL
```
https://www.example.com:443/path/to/resource?query=param#fragment
```
- **Scheme**: `https` (protocol, e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, FTP).
- **Subdomain**: `www` (optional, e.g., blog, api).
- **Domain**: `example.com` (the main address).
- **Port**: `:443` (optional, default for HTTPS; HTTP uses 80).
- **Path**: `/path/to/resource` (location of the resource on the server).
- **Query String**: `?query=param` (parameters for dynamic content).
- **Fragment**: `#fragment` (specific section of the page).

### Purpose
- Identifies the location of a resource.
- Specifies how to access it (protocol).
- Supports dynamic content via query parameters.

  - Modify CSS in the **Styles** pane (e.g., change colors, fonts).
  - Changes are client-side and reset on page refresh.
- **Using JavaScript**:
  - In the **Console**, run JavaScript to manipulate the DOM:
    ```javascript
    document.querySelector('h1').innerText = 'New Heading';
    document.body.style.backgroundColor = 'blue';
    ```
- **Permanent Changes**:
  - Requires access to the website’s source code (e.g., via a CMS or server).
  - Edit HTML/CSS/JavaScript files and redeploy to the server.
- **Limitations**:
  - Client-side changes are temporary and local.
  - Server-side changes require authentication and deployment.

### Use Cases
- Debugging UI issues (misaligned elements, broken styles).
- Testing design changes before coding.
- Learning how websites are built.
